# AI Engineering Journey 🚀  

This repository documents my self-taught journey into **AI Engineering**, following the **Codebasics AI Engineer Roadmap**. I'll be learning and implementing concepts in **machine learning, deep learning, and MLOps**, while sharing my progress and projects along the way.  

## 📌 Learning Roadmap (Based on Codebasics)  
I am following a structured 8-month plan that covers:  

- ✅ **Computer Science Fundamentals** (Networking, Algorithms, Programming)  
- ✅ **Python Basics & Advanced Concepts** (OOP, Exception Handling, Modules)  
- ✅ **Data Structures & Algorithms** (Arrays, Trees, Sorting, Graphs)  
- ✅ **Version Control with Git & GitHub**  
- ✅ **SQL for Data Engineering**  
- ✅ **Data Analysis & Visualization** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- ✅ **Mathematics & Statistics for AI**  
- ✅ **Machine Learning** (Supervised, Unsupervised, Feature Engineering)  
- ✅ **Deep Learning & Neural Networks** (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs)  
- ✅ **MLOps & Deployment** (Docker, FastAPI, AWS, Langchain)  

> **Total Duration:** *8 Months (4 Hours Daily)*
